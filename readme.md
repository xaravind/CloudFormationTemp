**"Fully Automated VPC and EC2 Setup with VPC Peering â€” Powered by CloudFormation"**

Provision **two isolated VPCs** (Internal & Client), launch **public and private EC2 instances** in each, and **enable secure cross-VPC communication** between private instances via **VPC Peering**, using only **CloudFormation templates**.

### **What We'll Build â€” Fully Automated via CloudFormation**

With **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using **AWS CloudFormation**, we'll build a complete, production-like network setup **without any manual steps**:

1. **Create Two VPCs** â€“ Each with custom CIDR blocks for logical separation (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16` and `10.1.0.0/16`).
2. **Deploy Public and Private Subnets** â€“ In each VPC, spread across different Availability Zones.
3. **Launch EC2 Instances** â€“ One public and one private instance in each VPC.
4. **Establish VPC Peering** â€“ To enable communication between private subnets in both VPCs.
5. **Configure Route Tables** â€“ Modify route tables to allow secure, cross-VPC traffic flow.

Final
 **Test file transfer** between private instances (via Bastion/Jump host)

Your notes are clear and straightforward! I've cleaned up the grammar, improved sentence flow slightly, and kept the tone simple and easy to understand â€” just like your original style. Here's the refined version:

### **Letâ€™s Build**

First Stage :- Write CloudFormation templates in your local **VS Code** using **YAML format**.

CloudFormation supports both **JSON** and **YAML**, but YAML is much simpler to write and read. Unlike other languages, YAML has zero complexity in formatting. It is also easier compared to **Terraform**, which uses its own custom language (HashiCorp Configuration Language - HCL).

> For this template, I used references from the official AWS documentation:

```bash
#01-vpc-CFT.yml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: This template deploys a VPC, with a public and a private subnets spread
  across two Availability Zones. It deploys an internet gateway, with a default
  route on the public subnets. It deploys a  NAT gateways,
  and default routes for them in the private subnets.

###  **Best Practices I Followed While Writing This Template**

* **Used Parameters**: So we can reuse the template multiple times just by changing values â€” no need to touch the actual code.
* The template creates **all the required networking components**, including:

  * VPC
  * Public and Private Subnets
  * Internet Gateway (IGW) and attachment to VPC
  * Route Tables for both public and private
  * Subnet-to-Route Table associations
  * NAT Gateway with Elastic IP for internet access from the private subnet

---

> **I followed the same best practices from `vpc-CFT.yml` to create both `ec2-CFT.yml` and `vpc-peering.yml` templates.**

```bash

```

To use the above template, all you need beforehand is:

* A valid **VPC**
* An existing **EC2 key pair**

Once provided, this template will automatically launch an EC2 instance into your chosen **public** or **private** subnet.

---

### **Best Practices I Followed While Writing This Template**

* **Used Parameters** to make the template reusable across environments. You only need to provide values like VPC ID, subnet ID, instance type, and key name during launch.

* **Used Mappings** to dynamically select the correct AMI based on the region. No need to hardcode AMI IDs.

* **Included Conditions** to toggle public IP assignment, allowing flexibility between public and private subnets.

* **Defined a Security Group** to allow SSH (port 22) access. You can customize this for stricter rules.

* **Used Block Device Mappings** to configure an 8GB `gp3` EBS volume that gets deleted on instance termination.

* **Clean Outputs Section** that returns the Instance ID, Private IP (always), and Public IP (only for public subnets). Useful for validation or automation.

Once the Templates are finished push to your Git-hub repo

```bash
aravi@Aravind MINGW64 ~/11_04/CloudFormationTemp (main)
$ git add . ; git commit -m "ll" ; git push

In this stage, we write all the required template files and push them to GitHub for version control and reuse.

Second Stage: Launch Infra with Cloud Formation








###  What is a VPC and Why Do We Need It?

A **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is an isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch resourcesâ€”like EC2 instancesâ€”within a logically separated network. It provides full control over:

* âœ… **IP address ranges** using CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
* âœ… **Subnets**, **routing**, and **internet access**
* âœ… **Security** through Security Groups and Network ACLs

In simple terms, a VPC allows you to design your own virtual data center in the cloudâ€”with complete control over who can access what and how.

---

In **real-time scenarios**, every organization uses VPCs to host internal applications and services securely. Typically, employees or administrators **access VPCs through VPN connections**, **Direct Connect**, or **bastion hosts (jump servers)** for internal/private resource management.

VPCs play a vital role in:

* Segregating production, staging, and development environments
* Ensuring secure and private communication across AWS services
* Supporting hybrid cloud models with on-premises integration

---

###  Key VPC Components:

#### ðŸ”¹ Subnets:

* **Public Subnet:** A subnet whose instances can directly communicate with the internet via an Internet Gateway.
* **Private Subnet:** A subnet that has no direct internet access. Resources inside can only access the internet via a NAT Gateway..

#### ðŸ”¹ Route Tables:

* **Public Route Table:** Contains routes that direct traffic from public subnets to the Internet Gateway.
* **Private Route Table:** Contains routes for private subnets, typically directing internet-bound traffic through a NAT Gateway.

#### ðŸ”¹ Gateways:

* **Internet Gateway (IGW):** A gateway that allows instances in a public subnet to connect to the internet.
* **NAT Gateway (NGW):** Allows instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing inbound traffic from the internet.

#### ðŸ”¹ Security Layers:

* **Security Groups:** Virtual firewalls at the instance level.
* **NACLs (Network ACLs):** Optional stateless firewalls at the subnet level.

---

###  What is VPC Peering and Why Is It Used?

**VPC Peering** is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPs. Itâ€™s commonly used to allow:

* Communication between different environments (e.g., dev and prod)
* File sharing between isolated networks
* Secure cross-VPC service interaction without going over the internet

---

### ðŸ”¹ AWS Services Used in This Setup:

* **CloudFormation:** Automates the provisioning of infrastructure via templates (IaC).
* **VPC:** Defines isolated network boundaries and routing.
* **EC2:** Hosts public and private instances for secure file transfers and communication across VPCs.
